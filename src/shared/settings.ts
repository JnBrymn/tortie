 * REPAIR and it is a truthfulness repair rather than a shape preference. The
 * build this round verified concatenated both layers into one `shared` list and
 * drew the SEAL's sentence — "Ignored, because they were not added here" — over
 * all of it. Measured on the shipping store on 2026-09-16: a settings file
 * holding sixteen shape-valid junk names ahead of a name the seal DOES cover
 * pushed the real name out at the SHAPE layer, and the one line telling a person
 * why their own confirmed key stopped arriving named that key FIRST and told
 * them it had never been added here. It had. The two layers mean different
 * things to the person reading them, so they are two fields and two sentences:
 *
 *  - `shared` is the SEAL's answer. The name is well formed and Tortie would
 *    read it; no human confirmed it in this window. Adding it here fixes it.
 *  - `sharedUnread` is the SHAPE layer's answer. Tortie will not read that name
 *    at all — it is not a name, or it is on a denylist, or it is a duplicate, or
 *    it is past the sixteen this door reads. Adding it here does NOT fix it, so
 *    sending a person to the Add sheet would be sending them to a dead end.
 *
 * SAFE TO DRAW, by construction. Every string on this shape has already passed
 * `OVERLAY_ENV_KEY_PATTERN` — letters, digits and underscore, at most 64 bytes,
 * no newline — so nothing here is a rendering primitive. An entry that could
 * NOT be named safely (a non-string, a 4 KB blob, a string with a newline in
 * it) is counted in `unnamed` and is never echoed. That is the difference
 * between "never silently dropped" and "hand an attacker a DOM".
 *
 * AND EVERY LIST HERE IS BOUNDED, which the verified build's was not. The seal
 * half always was, because the seal runs over the already-capped sanitized
 * settings; the shape half was not, because it ran over the RAW file. Measured
 * the same day: 200,000 junk names in `settings.json` produced 200,000 echoed
 * names and a single 12,088,932-byte paragraph in the Settings window. The count
 * past the echo cap is `sharedUnreadOver` — counted, never echoed, the same
 * channel `unnamed` already is.
 *
 * PHASE 278 ADDS A THIRD THING THAT CAN GO WRONG, AND IT IS A COUNT. The two
 * fields above are both about a name that IS in `settings.json` and is not
 * being used. The third is the other way round: a name the seal covers —
 * meaning a person confirmed it in this window — that the finished lists do
 * NOT contain, because the file no longer holds it or because a later build
 * refuses its shape. Until this phase that case was silent everywhere, and it
 * is the only one where the person is not at fault for anything.
 *
 * ON THE SHARED CARD IT COUNTS ONLY THE FIRST CAUSE (the Phase 278 fix round).
 * A sealed shared name the file still holds and the shape layer refused is
 * already NAMED in `sharedUnread`, or counted in `sharedUnreadOver`, on the same
 * card. Counting it here as well drew two sentences about one name, and the
 * second one said "Add it again", which the Add sheet would then refuse. An
 * agent card draws no shape-layer report, so `perAgentMissing` counts both
 * causes.
 *
 * IT IS A COUNT AND NEVER A LIST, and that is a consequence of a rule this
 * module already keeps rather than a preference. A per-agent seal key is
 * `envNameKey(id, name)` and no seal key in this repository is ever split back
 * apart; recovering the bare name to draw it would be the first parser over a
 * key space whose whole safety argument is that a key only has to be
 * UNAMBIGUOUS. One rule for both lists rather than a cleverer rule that names
 * them on the shared card and counts them on the agent cards.
 *
 * NAMES ONLY. There is no field here that could carry a value.

 * Coerce a parsed `envPassthroughShared` value into a valid list, and SAY WHAT

 *
 * A NEW FUNCTION rather than a widening of `sanitizeEnvPassthrough` below, for
 * two reasons. That one takes a MAP and asks `agentEnvKeys(id)`, and a shared
 * list has no agent. And its documented silence is a contract Phase 269 wrote
 * and this phase does not edit — the reporting belongs to the new field.
 *
 * THE UNIT THAT IS DROPPED WHOLE IS ONE NAME. A name is kept entirely or
 * dropped entirely: never trimmed, case-folded, truncated, de-duplicated into
 * something else, or otherwise repaired into an acceptable shape. The FIELD is
 * dropped whole only when it is not an array.
 *
 * ONE BAD ENTRY NEVER DENIES THE REST, and that is a security decision rather
 * than a convenience. Dropping the whole list because one entry is junk is a
 * denial any agent with write access could author in one line, and it would
 * take away every key a person set. Per-name dropping fails closed per name,
 * and it is the treatment `sanitizeEnvPassthrough` already gives.
 *
 * `sharedRefusedEnvKeys` is the union of every launchable agent's compiled
 * `launch.env` keys — today exactly `FORCE_COLOR` (cursor) and
 * `GROK_PRIVACY_NOTICE_ROLLOUT` (grok). Refusing them HERE is the honest
 * answer: the shared list reaches cursor too, and a shared `FORCE_COLOR` would
 * make the `env-unresolved` notice say a cursor pane started WITHOUT a variable
 * that pane actually has, which is the exact dishonesty
 * `envPassthroughRefusal`'s last check exists to prevent.
 *
 * `refused` IS CAPPED, AND THE FIX ROUND ADDED THAT CAP. Everything else on
 * this function was bounded by the sixteen `envPassthroughRefusal` enforces,
 * because `names` is what the cap counts. `refused` is not — it runs over the
 * RAW file, whose length is chosen by whoever wrote the file, which since this
 * phase is the exact actor layer one of the seal names. The verified build
 * pushed every refused entry into it, `store.ts` copied the whole list into the
 * `settings:envRejections` answer, and `env-copy.ts` joined the lot into ONE
 * paragraph in the Settings window. Measured against the shipping store on
 * 2026-09-16, with a 53-byte name: 1,000 names gave a 57,932-byte line, 50,000
 * gave 2,988,932 bytes, and 200,000 gave 12,088,932 bytes at a 115 ms load. A
 * SECOND re-derivation the same day, with a short name, read 11,888 bytes at
 * 1,000 — the same defect at a fifth the size, and the two readings are quoted
 * together on purpose, because the per-name cost is chosen by whoever writes the
 * file and so is the count. Nothing was unsafe — every echoed byte had passed
 * the alphabet — but a rendering primitive is a size as well as a character set,
 * and the size was the attacker's to choose.
 *
 * So the echo stops at the number this domain already spells, sixteen, and the
 * rest is a COUNT in `refusedOver`. A count is the channel `unnamed` has always
 * been, and it is separate from `unnamed` because the two say different things
 * to a person: `unnamed` means "that was not a variable name", `refusedOver`
 * means "there were more of these and Tortie stopped listing them".
 *
 * It never throws.

/**
 * PHASE 278 — WHY THESE TWO FUNCTIONS EXIST, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT IN THE
 * SANITIZER ABOVE.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `sanitizeEnvPassthrough` admits names in FILE ORDER and stops at
 * sixteen. The seal — "who wrote this?" — is asked four steps later, in
 * `withSealedDangerState` in src/main/settings/store.ts. So sixteen
 * valid-looking names written by anything with write access to the home
 * directory consume the whole budget before anything asks who wrote them, and
 * the seventeenth — the one the person confirmed in the Settings window — is
 * gone at the shape layer before the seal ever sees it. The seal then rejects
 * the sixteen. The person ends with no names, and the one line that exists to
 * explain it names sixteen strings they never typed and not the one they did.
 *
 * IT FAILS CLOSED, and that is said here so nobody reads this block as a
 * patched escalation. No extra name was ever authorised, no value was ever
 * resolved, nothing leaked. The defect is that a person loses a setting they
 * made and is not told which one — and at the parent commit the loss became
 * PERMANENT at the next save, because `persistSettings` writes the
 * seal-filtered settings and re-seals to them.
 *
 * WHY NOT INSIDE THE SANITIZER. The research that drove this rejected "apply
 * the seal before the cap" for four mechanical reasons, and every one of them
 * is about putting the seal INSIDE `sanitizeEnvPassthrough`: that function is
 * memoised, runs before `app.isReady()`, is also the WRITE path through
 * `applySettingsPatch` where the seal must NOT be consulted, and its documented
 * contract is that it "bounds the SHAPE of a value; it cannot tell who wrote
 * the file". All four dissolve when the pass lives at the SEAL SITE instead,
 * which already has the opened seal in hand and runs on the read path only.
 * These two functions are the pure half of that; `withSealedDangerState` calls
 * them. The sanitizers above are untouched, byte for byte.
 *
 * NOTHING IS REORDERED, which is the objection Phase 275 recorded when it
 * half-closed this ("a sanitizer that reorders admits a list nobody wrote").
 * The answer is not "put the confirmed names first". It is "do not spend the
 * budget on names that are about to be thrown away one step later". The output
 * of `confirmedEnvNames` is a SUBSEQUENCE of its input: same elements, same
 * relative order, nothing added, nothing moved. Every element and every
 * adjacency belongs to the file, so a list nobody wrote is unreachable rather
 * than merely avoided.
 */

/**
 * Every entry of a raw passthrough list that is a NAME, in the file's own
 * order (Phase 278). Nothing is trimmed, case-folded, truncated, de-duplicated
 * or repaired — the unit that is kept or dropped is one whole entry, exactly as
 * it is in the sanitizers above.
 *
 * IT USES `isDrawableEnvName`, which is the same test the shape layer already
 * makes, so this filter can never lose a name the seal covers: a sealed name
 * got into the seal by passing `envPassthroughRefusal`, whose first check is
 * the same length bound and the same {@link OVERLAY_ENV_KEY_PATTERN}. What it
 * does drop is the 4 KB blob and the entry with a newline in it, which have to
 * be gone before anything downstream can hold them.
 *
 * NOT `envCandidateNames`. That name already belongs to the preload bridge
 * method and `settings:envCandidates`, which answer "which names does the
 * picker OFFER from the login shell". This function answers "which entries does
 * the FILE hold", and the fix round renamed it so the two are never confused in
 * the one domain where confusing them decides what a process receives.

/**
 * The names of one list Tortie will actually USE, given the seal (Phase 278).
 *
 * Walks `candidates` in the file's own order and keeps a name when the seal
 * covers it AND `envPassthroughRefusal` accepts it against the names kept so
 * far. Its accumulator therefore never grows past
 * `OVERLAY_LIMITS.maxEnvPassthroughNames`, because that refusal is where the
 * cap lives.
 *
 * THE SEAL IS ASKED FIRST AND THE REFUSAL SECOND, and the order is the whole
 * point of the function. `existing` is the accumulator either way, so asking
 * the refusal first would keep exactly the same names — but it would read as if
 * the budget were still being spent on entries that are about to be discarded,
 * and this function exists to say that it is not.
 *
 * THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `break` ON THE CAP, and that is not an oversight.
 * This function copies NO rule from `envPassthroughRefusal`: not the duplicate
 * check, not the three denylists, not the compiled-key check, and not the cap.
 * Writing `if (kept.length >= OVERLAY_LIMITS.maxEnvPassthroughNames) break` here
 * would be a second spelling of the sixteen, in a second file, that a later
 * round could move on its own — so the cap is REACHED rather than restated, and
 * the walk simply stops accumulating once the refusal starts saying no. The
 * cost is one refusal call per remaining entry, which is what
 * `sanitizeEnvPassthroughShared` already pays over the same raw list.
 *
 * IT ADMITS NOTHING. `isSealed` is the same question `withSealedDangerState`
 * asks today, made no wider: a name no human confirmed is dropped. A name the
 * seal covers that this build refuses on SHAPE is still dropped, because both
 * tests must pass — which is what stops a seal from ever laundering `PATH` onto
 * a list.
