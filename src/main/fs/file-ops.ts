/**
 * The file-operations service behind fs:createFile / fs:createFolder /
 * fs:rename / fs:move / fs:trash (Phase 12.9).
 *
 * Rules this module exists to enforce, all of them in one place:
 *  - Every path goes through `resolveInsideRoot` (paths.ts) before the disk
 *    is touched: no `..`, no absolute path outside the project, no escape
 *    through a directory symlink, no `.git` at any depth.
 *  - DELETE MEANS TRASH. Nothing here calls unlink or rm — `trashItem` is
 *    injected (Electron's `shell.trashItem` in production) so a delete is
 *    recoverable from Finder by construction, and so the guards can be unit
 *    tested without Electron.
 *  - A move that would overwrite resolves with `status: 'would-overwrite'`
 *    and moves NOTHING, so the UI can prompt naming every collision at once.
 *    A confirmed overwrite trashes the displaced entry before renaming — an
 *    overwrite is still not a destruction.
 *  - Moves and renames are plain `fs.rename`: git infers the rename, so a
 *    tracked file keeps its history and `git status` stays sane.
 *  - PHASE 154. `importPaths` is the one verb whose SOURCE is deliberately
 *    outside the root, and it obeys every rule above: the destination goes
 *    through the same unchanged guard, collisions are found before a byte is
 *    written, and a confirmed overwrite trashes the displaced entry first. It
 *    COPIES, so the original stays where it was.
 *  - PHASE 274. **An answer is spelled under the root the CALLER named.** See
 *    the section below; it is the one rule in this list that is about the
 *    reply rather than about the disk.
 *
 * Nothing here writes file CONTENT — created files are empty, which is what
 * the tree's inline-rename-on-create flow wants.
 *
 * ## PHASE 274 — WHICH SPELLING THIS MODULE ANSWERS IN
 *
 * THE DEFECT, MEASURED IN THE RUNNING APP. Two kinds of channel serve one
 * file tree and they did not agree about what a file is called. `fs:readDir`
 * ECHOES the caller's spelling — it resolves `dirPath` and composes each child
 * onto the string it was handed (`./ipc.ts:208`) — while every mutation verb
 * in this module composed its answer from `realRoot`, which is `realpath`'d.
 * On a project whose stored spelling is not the disk's, those are two
 * different strings for one file, and on a case-insensitive volume (the APFS
 * default, which both the reporter's Mac and the operator's run) that happens
 * to anybody who opens `~/source/proj` while the disk says `~/Source/proj`.
 *
 * What it cost, driven over a real case-mismatched folder: **6 of 23 tree
 * steps passed on the person's spelling against 23 of 23 on the disk's, and
 * all 17 failures were silent** — no toast, no console error. A file created
 * from the tree opened no tab, a rename did not follow an open tab, a move
 * that would have clobbered raised no confirmation, a `.git` drop was not
 * refused, and one folder was drawn twice. The same split sent ⌘S out of the
 * compare-and-swap door, because `fileInRepo` is a prefix test of the tab's
 * path against the project's and the two no longer shared a prefix — which is
 * the shape issue 16 exists to prevent.
 *
 * THE RULE. `entry()` composes `path` from the root the caller named and
 * `relPath` from `realRoot`. Nothing else moves. Containment is unchanged:
 * `resolveOpenProjectRoot` and `resolveInsideRoot` are called in the same
 * order with the same arguments, `realRoot` is still the value every guard is
 * asked about, and the string this hands back is re-proved by both of them the
 * next time it is used — Phase 273 already made the caller-spelled absolute
 * form admissible on re-entry. So this is a decision about the REPLY and not a
 * weakening of the gate.
 *
 * AND THE DESTRUCTIVE ACTS STILL USE THE RESOLVED PATH. A confirmed overwrite
 * trashes the displaced entry by `destAbs`, the value `resolveInsideRoot`
 * proved, rather than by the re-spelled `path` on the answer beside it. On a
 * folding volume the two name one file and it would not matter; the rule is
 * that what acts is what the guard measured, and it costs nothing to keep.

 *

 * disk. That is what we want for every shape except ONE.
 *
 * **A `..` SEGMENT IS REFUSED, and it is the only shape where the caller's
 * spelling and the disk's walk do not describe the same folder.** `resolve`
 * applies `..` LEXICALLY and `realpath` applies it PHYSICALLY, so for a root
 * spelled `/a/link/../b`, with `link` a symlink to `/x/y`, `resolve` answers
 * `/a/b` while `realpath` answers `/x/b`. Those are two different directories,
 * and re-spelling an answer from one under the other would name a file that is
 * not the file the verb just acted on. Every other shape is safe by
 * construction: a symlinked ancestor, a case difference and a normalisation
 * difference are all spellings the walk really passes through, which is why
 * `/a/link/b/f.txt` IS a spelling of the file at `/x/y/b/f.txt`.
 *
 * The fallback is the resolved root, which is exactly what this module
 * answered in before Phase 274, so a caller that spells a root this way is
 * left where it already was rather than given a wrong answer.
 *
 * **AND IT CANNOT FIRE TODAY, which was measured rather than assumed.**
 * `resolveProjectRoot` (`./paths.ts:381`) is `realpath(resolve(root))` — it
 * resolves the `..` LEXICALLY first and hands `realpath` the already-resolved
 * string — so `real` is by construction the canonical form of the very
 * spelling this composes under, and the `/a/link/../b` shape is refused by
 * that gate before it reaches here. `p274-caller-spelling.test.ts` pins that
 * refusal. The clause stays because the ordering it depends on lives in
 * ANOTHER module: a later round that realpathed the raw string instead would
 * make `underCallerRoot` silently wrong, and one `split` is a cheap thing to
