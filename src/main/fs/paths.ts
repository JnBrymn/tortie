/**
 * Path guards for every fs:* MUTATION channel (Phase 12.9).
 *
 * One function does the whole job — `resolveInsideRoot` — because a guard
 * that can be skipped is not a guard. Every mutation resolves each of its
 * paths through it before touching the disk, and it refuses four families:
 *
 *   1. `..` escapes            'src/../../etc/passwd'
 *   2. absolute paths outside  '/etc/passwd'
 *   3. symlinks out of root    a link inside the project pointing at $HOME,
 *                              including one that only appears in an
 *                              ANCESTOR of a path that does not exist yet
 *   4. `.git` at any depth     source or destination, per shared/fs-ops.ts
 *
 * SYMLINK RULE — parents are resolved, the leaf is not. `realpath` on the
 * leaf would resolve a symlinked FILE to its target, so renaming or trashing
 * a link that points outside the project would be refused (wrong: the link
 * itself lives inside), and worse, a rename could follow the link and write
 * outside. Resolving only the parent chain gives both properties: you cannot
 * reach out of the tree through a directory symlink, and a symlink leaf is
 * treated as the entry it is.
 *
 * PHASE 273 — THE SECOND CHANCE FOR AN ABSOLUTE SPELLING, and why it widens
 * none of the four families above.
 *
 * `addProject` stores `path.resolve(…)` and never `realpath`
 * (sessions/core.ts:2891), so a project opened through a symlink is REMEMBERED
 * through it, and the tree builds every tab's path by concatenating onto that
 * stored spelling (FileTree.tsx:501). `resolveProjectRoot` below realpaths the
 * root. So for such a project the two sides of the containment comparison were
 * two spellings of one folder, the lexical test refused, and every save in the
 * project answered "its project is not open". That is issue 25, belucid on
 * 0.106.0: a person who could not save any file, ever.
 *
 * A lexical failure is therefore no longer final. The function asks the string
 * comparison one question and the DISK a different one, in that order, and the
 * order is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. PLACE the path. Is this spelling a spelling of something inside the
 *      project? A relative input, and an absolute one already under the real
 *      root, is placed by the string comparison. Anything else is placed by
 *      `hasAncestorInsideRoot`, which climbs to the first ancestor that
 *      resolves and compares THAT to the real root, with the errno never
 *      consulted. A stranger and an unreadable stranger therefore get one
 *      answer, and this gate never becomes an oracle for the disk outside the
 *      project.
 *   2. RESOLVE it. `realpathOfAncestors` of the parent chain, for every input
 *      alike, then containment again against its answer, then `abs` composed
 *      from the resolved parent. Only a path that passed 1 gets here, which is
 *      what lets this step say `unreadable` and name a folder.
 *
 * Two clauses bound it and both are load bearing:
 *
 *   - A RELATIVE input is never placed by step 1's second half. It is resolved
 *     FROM `realRoot`, so the only way it can fail the string comparison is by
 *     climbing out with '..', and a climb is refused. An alias CAN explain such
 *     a climb — '../alias/README.md' lands on the project's own alias, and it
 *     is measured and refused — so the bound is a decision about what a
 *     relative path means, not a claim that the shape is impossible.
 *   - The leaf is still never resolved, so `abs` is composed exactly as it was
 *     and the SYMLINK RULE above is unchanged in text and in behaviour. The
 *     alias ROOT itself is the one declared limit that follows: `dirname` of it
 *     is outside the project, so step 1 refuses it with `allowRoot` and
 *     without.
 *
 * What that admits is one CLASS, stated as a property rather than as a list: an
 * ABSOLUTE input whose parent chain resolves INSIDE the real root. Every member
 * of it names a file the relative spelling already reached, because `abs` is
 * built from the RESOLVED parent and never from the caller's spelling, and it
 * is checked against the root twice more after that. The property is the
 * declaration; these are examples of it rather than an enumeration, because an
 * enumeration of the ways one directory can be spelled is a promise nobody can
 * keep:
 *
 *   - the symlink alias, which is the point, and a chain of them;
 *   - the case variant on a case-insensitive volume, which names the same file,
 *     whose ancestors come back canonical from `realpath`, and whose LEAF keeps
 *     the caller's case — already true today for a relative input, where
 *     'src/INDEX.TS' is accepted with exactly that spelling as `rel`;
 *   - a symlink ANYWHERE on the disk pointing INTO the project, or at its
 *     parent, which is the same file reached by a longer name;
 *   - '/tmp/…' for '/private/tmp/…', because /tmp, /var and /etc are symlinks
 *     on every Mac.
 *
 * Measured over the phase's fixture on both bases: every escape shape answered
 * `outside` before and after, every admitted row's `abs` is inside the real
 * root, and the rows that moved are that class plus the refusal WORDS the
 * second half of the phase splits apart. `npm run conformance:containment` is
 * that table as a gate.

  //
  //   1. Is this spelling a spelling of something INSIDE the project? For a
  //      relative input and for an absolute one under the real root, the string
  //      comparison above already answered yes. For anything else,
  //      `hasAncestorInsideRoot` answers it by resolving an ANCESTOR, with the
  //      errno never consulted, so a stranger and an unreadable stranger get
  //      one answer.
  //   2. What does it resolve to? `realpathOfAncestors` below, for every input
  //      alike, and its answer is compared to the root again.
  //
  // Only a path that passed 1 reaches 2. That ordering is what lets step 2 say
  // `unreadable` and name a folder without this gate becoming an oracle for the
  // disk outside the project, which is the one thing containment exists to
  // refuse. Measured: '<root>/locked/sub/x.txt' and '<alias>/locked/sub/x.txt'
  // under a mode-000 folder both answer `unreadable` carrying EACCES, while
  // '<scratch>/lockedout/sub/x.txt' answers `outside`, indistinguishable from
  // '/nope-xyz/deep/file.txt'.
  //
  // WHY THE WALK RATHER THAN ONE `realpath`, WHICH IS WHAT THE FIRST ROUND
  // SHIPPED. That round bounded the second chance to a parent that already
  // EXISTS and argued no product caller could reach the bound. The argument was
  // wrong twice over. A tab open on a file whose folder an agent removes before
  // ⌘S is the everyday case in this product, and through the alias it answered
  // `outside` — "it is not inside the project it was opened from" — where the
  // same file by its real spelling answered `missing`, "it is no longer on
  // disk". Same file, same disk state, two sentences, one of them false. An
  // unreadable ancestor and a symlink loop split the same way. The walk is what
  // the real spelling has always taken, so taking it here is what makes "a
  // symlinked project behaves like any other" a measured fact rather than a
  // claim about saving alone.
  //
  // WHY ONLY AN ABSOLUTE INPUT, and the reason is containment rather than cost.
  // A relative input is resolved FROM `realRoot` where `lexical` is composed
  // above, so the ONLY way it can fail the test is by climbing out with '..'.
  // It is NOT true that no alias can explain such a climb — measured,

/**
 * Validate the name of a file that is arriving from OUTSIDE the project, and

 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `assertBasename`. That function exists for a name a PERSON
 * TYPED, into the inline rename box or the New File sheet, and its `trim()` is
 * the right answer there: somebody who types a trailing space did not mean it.
 * This function exists for a name that is ALREADY ON DISK, which nobody is
 * typing and which Tortie has no business editing.
 *
 * Running an incoming name through the typed-name rule did two things, both
 * measured end to end before this was written:
 *
 *  1. It SILENTLY RENAMED the file. A drop of `novel.txt ` landed as
 *     `novel.txt` and the person was told nothing. Finder does not do that,
 *     and Tortie's own internal move does not do it either: moving ` mv.ts`
 *     into `src/` keeps the space.
 *  2. Worse, it MANUFACTURED an overwrite. A file genuinely named ` keep.ts`
 *     dropped into a folder holding `keep.ts` trimmed onto the existing name,
 *     so the confirm sheet asked about `keep.ts`, a file the person never
 *     dragged. Confirming trashed the real `keep.ts` and put different bytes
 *     in its place. Recoverable from the Trash, and still the wrong question
 *     answered, which is the one thing this whole surface promises not to do.
 *
 * So the name is checked and never edited. The checks are the ones that
 * decide whether a name can escape the destination folder or name something
 * Tortie must not write, and nothing about taste:
 *
 *   - a non-empty string, and not one that is ONLY whitespace, because that
 *     is a name no sheet can show and no person can read back;
 *   - not '.' or '..' in either its real spelling or its trimmed one;
 *   - no '/' and no NUL, which are the two bytes that could reach outside the
 *     folder that was aimed at;
 *   - not `.git`, and the TRIMMED spelling is tested for that too. This is
 *     the one place the trim survives on purpose. Before this repair a folder
 *     named ` .git ` was caught by accident, because the trim ran first, and
 *     dropping the trim without this line would have quietly given that back.
 *     It is refused on how it READS rather than on what it is.

/**

 * This is the one input in the whole fs contract that is allowed to name
 * something the project does not contain, so it gets its own function rather
 * than a flag on `resolveInsideRoot`. That refusal is the guard every other
 * mutation rests on and it stays exactly as strict as it was.
 *
 * What it proves, and each is load bearing:
 *
 *   1. It is a non empty string with no NUL. A dropped file whose path could
 *      not be read arrives as '', and copying from '' would resolve to the
 *      process's working directory.
 *   2. It is ABSOLUTE. There is no base to resolve a relative one against:
 *      the source is not in the project, so `realRoot` is the wrong anchor
 *      and the working directory is nobody's intent.
 *   3. It EXISTS, and every symlink in it is resolved, LEAF INCLUDED. This is
 *      the one place the module's own symlink rule is deliberately inverted,
 *      and the reason is containment rather than taste: the caller compares
 *      this answer against the destination to refuse a folder copied into
 *      itself, and a link left unresolved defeats that comparison. A link in
 *      /tmp pointing at the project's own folder would otherwise read as a
 *      stranger. The cost is that dropping an alias brings in what it points
 *      at, which is what "bring this in" means for a file you can only see
