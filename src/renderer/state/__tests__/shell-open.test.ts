 * renderer's half of the contract:
 *
 *  - a folder-only pull opens the project and touches nothing else;
 *  - a folder-plus-file pull opens the project FIRST, arms the editor's
 *    open-bus subscription, then emits one pinned tree-shaped open;
 *  - a null pull, a missing bridge and a rejected pull all do nothing;
 *  - a failed addProjectPath abandons the file half on purpose;
 *  - deliveries run one at a time and in call order (Phase 62.1), so the
 *    last file the user opened emits last and wins the active tab.
