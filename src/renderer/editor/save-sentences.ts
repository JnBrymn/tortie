/**
 * What a save says when it does not happen, and what it asks when the file
 * moved underneath it (Phase 240, issue 16).
 *
 * A sibling of ./redline-sentences.ts and written to the same rule: the write
 * channel answers a WORD (`FsGuardedWriteRefusal` in @shared/fs-ops) and this
 * turns the word into one plain sentence for a person, naming the file and
 * saying what to do rather than what went wrong in machine terms. Just enough
 * words: one or two short sentences each, no paragraph, no jargon.
 *
 * IT MATCHES THE REMOTE SAVE'S VOCABULARY ON PURPOSE (charter item 5).
 * `saveOnMachine` has carried a precondition through `machines:putFile` since
 * Phase 101 and says "Tortie did not save this file, because it changed on
 * {machine} after Tortie read it. Nothing was written." — the shape is
 * `../machines/editor.ts` and it is deliberately reused here so a person meets
 * one idea rather than two. Every refusal ends with what did or did not happen
 * to the file, and none of them ends with a stack.
 *
 * THE MAP IS TOTAL over the words a local save can surface, so a word added to
 * the channel without a sentence here does not compile. `link` is excluded and
 * that is a decision rather than an omission: see {@link SaveRefusalWord}.
 *
 * It names no bridge, reads no file and writes nothing.

/**
 * The refusal words a LOCAL save can put in front of a person.
 *
 * `link` is excluded, and the reason is the one thing this phase had to decide
 * that the charter left open. A file inside a project that is a symbolic link
 * saves today: `fs:writeFile` follows the link and replaces what it points at,
 * which is what a person who made that link expects. The guarded channel
 * refuses it because it will not turn a link into a regular file, which is
 * right for a REWIND — nobody typed those bytes — and would be a save a person
 * has today taken away from them. So ./tab-io saves a link through the plain
 * door instead, and there is no sentence for it because nothing went wrong.
 *
 * THE FIX ROUND REFUTED THIS PARAGRAPH'S OWN SENTENCE, and the correction is
 * the point rather than the footnote. It read "and nothing is lost by it", and
 * that was measured in the running app and is false: typed into a symlinked
 * file inside a project, a `/bin/sh` wrote 17 bytes into the link's target,
 * ⌘S — and the outside write was gone, with no dialog, no toast and a clean
 * tab. That is issue 16 exactly, on a file that happens to be a link, so a
 * fallback with no check at all could not stand. The plain door in ./tab-io
 * now READS the file and compares it to what the buffer was built from before
 * it writes, and offers the same three answers when they differ.
 *
 * THE COMMITTER'S ROUND CLOSED TWO MORE HOLES IN THAT SAME DOOR, and both were
 * this phase's own subject line unmet. Its Overwrite was UNCONDITIONAL, so a
 * third writer arriving while the question was on screen was written over — 38
 * characters destroyed in the running app, against the guarded door re-asking
 * in the same run; it now carries the text it showed, reads the file at the
 * press, and writes only if the file still says it. And it wrote a lossy decode
 * back whole, so a latin-1 file reached through a link went 49 B to 58 B with
 * four U+FFFD in it and nothing said; it now refuses a text carrying U+FFFD
 * with the `notUtf8` sentence below, which is the same word the guarded channel
 * answers for the same file. THE STATED LIMIT IS THE WINDOW between the reading
 * and the write, which is one IPC round trip rather than the guarded channel's
 * two system calls, and it stays open because closing it means giving the
 * channel a mode for a link, which is a change to the channel this phase does
 * not make.

  // PHASE 240 FIX ROUND. `outside` reaches a person in exactly one shape, and

  // plain door and never asks the channel at all, so the only way to hear this
  // is a tab whose PROJECT WAS CLOSED under it: closing a project does not
  // close its tabs, the path is still inside its old root, and the channel
  // asks the open list. So the sentence names that cause and the remedy, in
  // the same two sentences the family uses.
  //
  // PHASE 273 MOVED IT FROM `outside` TO `projectClosed`, BYTE FOR BYTE, AND
  // THE MOVE IS THE FIX. The paragraph above was right about its cause and
  // wrong about which word carried it. `guarded-write.ts` answered `outside`
  // for every throw the two path guards make — a root that is no open project,
  // a path that escapes, a `.git` segment, a realpath that threw, a malformed
  // path, and Tortie failing to read its own project list — and this sentence
  // asserted the first of them to all six. Issue 25 is the bill: belucid's
  // project was OPEN, reached through a symlink, so the containment check
  // refused the path and he read this sentence on every file he ever tried to
  // save. The sentence is not reworded, because for the cause it names it was
  // already right; it just stopped being said about the other five.
  //
  // THE SECOND ROUTE THE PARAGRAPH BELOW WORRIED ABOUT IS NOW ITS OWN WORD.
  // `.git` is `protected` and says so, so the argument about whether any
  // gesture can open one no longer has to hold this sentence up.
  projectClosed:
    'Tortie did not save {name}, because its project is not open — open it again and save. Nothing was written.',
  // PHASE 273. What is left on `outside` is containment alone: the path is not
  // inside the real root of the project it was opened from. THE SENTENCE NAMES
  // NO REMEDY BECAUSE THERE IS NONE — the renderer composed this path from a
  // root it also chose, so a person did nothing to cause it and can do nothing
  // to clear it. After the containment repair a person should never meet this
  // word at all; if one does, it is a bug report, and the `fs.save.refused`
  // log line in src/main/fs/ipc.ts carries the root, the path and the reason
  // that answers it. A sentence that cannot name a remedy is better than one
  // that guesses a cause, and this is the sentence that rule is written for.
  outside:
    'Tortie did not save {name}, because it is not inside the project it was opened from. Nothing was written.',
  // PHASE 273. One word for two throw sites, and they are one cause to a
  // person: something between Tortie and the file could not be read. It covers
  // a folder that is gone, a disk ejected, a permission changed, a TCC denial
  // and a mount that has stalled, and it asserts none of them — the errno is
  // in the log, where somebody can act on it, and not in the sentence, where
  // guessing wrong is the defect this phase exists to remove.
  unreadable:
    'Tortie did not save {name}, because a folder on the way to it could not be read — check that the folder is still there. Nothing was written.',
  // PHASE 273. It does NOT merge into `outside`, even though the remedy is the
  // same — none — because the merged sentence would be FALSE. A file under
  // `.git` IS inside its project, and telling a person it is not is exactly the
  // lie this split exists to stop. Same remedy merges, unless the merged
  // sentence would assert something that was not measured.

  // when Tortie could not read its OWN list of open projects — a lazy import
  // that failed, a core that never booted, a SQLite read that threw — so it
  // never got as far as asking whether this project is open. Saying it is not
  // open would be a lie about the person's world to cover a fault in Tortie's.
  // The meetable one is concrete: on a machine where tmux cannot be found the
  // core re-runs boot on every call and every save read "its project is not
