/**
 * Phase 145 stage 5: the suite runs in lanes, so a check can state its
 * environment requirement instead of assuming the host.
 *
 *   npm test           both lanes, the full suite, what every battery runs
 *   npm run test:hermetic   only checks that control every effect they use:
 *                      no native file event stream is subscribed and no live
 *                      process table is read. Proved on 2026-08-24 by running
 *                      the whole lane over a watcher binding whose every call
 *                      throws: 9,333 tests passed unchanged.
 *   npm run test:native     only the *.native.test.ts files, the live
 *                      integration lane for the native adapters (FSEvents
 *                      delivery, the live ps table).
 *
 * The lane is picked here rather than by CLI globs so the file naming rule
 * `*.native.test.ts` has exactly one reader.

    // Vitest's own default is 5,000 ms, and that number is what has cost
    // this repository two whole runs. Neither test was slow: the release
    // build for 0.105.0 lost `harvest-claim-race` at 5,014 ms, and Phase
    // 80.1 lost `src/main/symbols/__tests__/store.test.ts` at 5,011 ms.
    // Both sit far below the budget on a quiet machine — the slowest test
    // body in the suite measures well under it — and both overran by a few
    // milliseconds only because a CI runner starved a worker at the wrong
    // moment.
    //
    // Raising this rather than the two tests is deliberate. The two are in
    // unrelated domains, so the pair is evidence about the RUNNER and not
    // about either test, and there is no way to predict which test a loaded
    // runner starves next. A per-test budget would have to be guessed onto
    // all 14,189 of them.
    //
    // The cost is bounded and it is the only cost: a test that genuinely
    // hangs now fails in 15 s instead of 5 s. Nothing that passes today
    // behaves differently, because a timeout is a ceiling and never a wait.
    // A file needing more still says so itself — `vi.setConfig` and the
    // third argument to `it` both still win, in either direction.

      // in by src/main/log/index.ts.
      //
      // That matters because electron 43 ships no install script. Its
      // index.js downloads the 100 MB binary LAZILY, inside whichever
      // process requires it first, with no retry. In `npm test` that is a
      // vitest worker, and one failed download killed release run
