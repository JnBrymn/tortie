/**
 * `npm run conformance:containment`, the gate on the one door every fs
 * mutation goes through (Phase 273).
 *
 * About 5 s. It launches no Electron, opens no window, starts no tmux server,
 * spawns no agent, makes no request, reads nothing under the person's home,
 * and writes nothing outside a `mkdtemp` fixture and a set of ablation copies,
 * both removed in a `finally`.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * Issue 25, belucid, 2026-09-15, on 0.106.0: a person who could not save any
 * file, ever, and was told each time that the project was not open. The cause
 * was two spellings of one folder. `addProject` stores `path.resolve(…)` and
 * never `realpath` (sessions/core.ts:2891), so a project opened through a
 * symlink is remembered through it and the tree builds each tab's path by
 * concatenating onto that spelling; `resolveProjectRoot` realpaths the root;
 * and `resolveInsideRoot` compared the two LEXICALLY and threw before its own
 * real guard — which resolves the parent and re-checks containment, and which
 * admits the alias — could answer.
 *
 * Phase 273 lets an ABSOLUTE input that fails the lexical test be PLACED by the
 * disk instead — one question about an ANCESTOR — and then resolved by the same
 * walk a relative path has always taken. That is a relaxation of the gate every
 * fs mutation asks, and a relaxation of a containment gate is exactly the kind
 * of thing that is right on the day and wrong two rounds later. So the phase's
 * escape checklist is this gate: every shape that must still be refused is
 * DRIVEN through the shipping guard, not read, and every row that moves is
 * driven too.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 *  1. THE MATRIX. Every row of the checklist, driven through the shipping
 *     `resolveInsideRoot`, `resolveProjectRoot` and `resolveOpenProjectRoot`
 *     over a fixture holding the alias, eight symlinks, a prefix-sibling
 *     decoy, a `.git` tree, a dangling link, a loop, a mode-000 directory and
 *     a real file whose name begins with two dots. The reading is the WORD the
 *     guard stamped, so the checklist and the refusal vocabulary are one table.
 *  2. ONE STAMPING FACTORY. `gmuxError(` is named once in the module and the
 *     once is inside `refuse`, and every `throw` in the module goes through
 *     `refuse`, `refuseOutside` or `refuseProtected`. A word that a throw site
 *     can forget is not a word the caller can trust.
 *  3. THE PLACING STEP IS BOUNDED. Inside the arm that runs when the string
 *     comparison fails: the input must be absolute, the containment question is
 *     asked by `hasAncestorInsideRoot` and asked AFTER the absolute test so a
 *     relative path costs no syscall, the block resolves nothing itself and
 *     walks no ancestors, it reads no errno, and its only answer is the
 *     containment refusal — it never returns a value.
 *  4. THE PLACER IS THE ANTI-ORACLE. `hasAncestorInsideRoot` climbs by
 *     `dirname` to the first ancestor that resolves and compares THAT to the
 *     real root. It answers rather than refuses, never reads an errno, and
 *     terminates at '/'. This is what stops `unreadable` saying anything about
 *     the disk OUTSIDE the project: a stranger and an unreadable stranger get
 *     one word.
 *  5. ONE RESOLUTION RULE, AND THE LEAF IS NEVER RESOLVED. `resolveInsideRoot`
 *     calls `realpath` zero times of its own and names `realpathOfAncestors`
 *     exactly once, so both spellings take the same walk; the walk's answer is
 *     compared to the root; and `abs` is composed from the resolved parent. The
 *     module's SYMLINK RULE is a promise about renaming and trashing a link,
 *     and this phase must not narrow it by accident.
 *  6. THE ROOT-WALK COMMENT SAYS WHAT IS TRUE. Its old text justified an
 *     unreachable throw with a premise the lexical check established, and a
 *     comment whose only stated reason is a premise a later round can lift is
 *     a comment that invites the lift. The new one names both reasons and the
 *     old sentence is gone.
 *  7. THE SEAM. The module exports the closed word set and one structural
 *     reader and nothing else of the mechanism, and it names no save word — so
 *     it stays ignorant of what a save SAYS, which is what lets the two halves
 *     of this phase be built at once.
 *  8. A gate nothing names is how a gate decays.
 *  9. THE ABLATIONS. One clause each, and each one DECLARES THE ROWS IT OWNS.
 *     A rule that cannot fail proves nothing, and an ablation that moves some
 *     other row than the one it is for proves something else.
 *
 * ## The two rows whose reading depends on the machine, declared rather than hidden
 *
 *  - THE CASE VARIANT is accepted on a case-insensitive volume and refused on
 *    a case-sensitive one. The probe reports which volume it ran on and this
 *    gate expects accordingly. It is not an escape either way: on that volume
 *    it names the same file, the ancestors come back canonical from `realpath`
 *    and only the LEAF keeps the caller's case — which is already true today
 *    for a relative input, where 'src/INDEX.TS' is accepted with that spelling.
 *  - THE UNREADABLE ANCESTOR INSIDE THE ROOT needs a directory the process
 *    cannot traverse, and uid 0 traverses everything. Under root the probe
 *    answers SKIPPED-ROOT and this gate says so rather than failing. The
 *    ablation that owns the `unreadable` stamp is carried by the symlink loop
 *    instead, which reads the same whoever runs it.
 *
 * `P273_ABLATION_DETAIL=1` prints which reading each ablation moved.

 * THE COPIES LIVE ONE LEVEL UNDER `src/main/`, and the depth is exact. The

 * fails to IMPORT rather than fail the rule it removed, and a probe red for the
 * wrong reason proves nothing. Each copy is a sibling of `fs/`, dotted so no
 * include glob and no test runner picks it up, and removed in the `finally`
 * whatever happened.
 *
 * Only `paths.ts` is copied: it is the whole module graph this probe loads.
