/**
 * probe-p284.mjs. THE PHASE 284 APP RUN: the work gets the one outline, and the
 * surround goes quiet.
 *
 * ONE Electron at a time on a scratch profile, a scratch HOME and the tmux
 * socket build/harness-socket.mjs hands it, over one git project it builds
 * inside its own scratch directory. Its sessions are plain shells
 * (`agent: 'shell'`): it spawns no agent, spends no token, opens no keychain
 * and makes no request. It adds NO renderer hook. Everything it drives goes
 * through the harness seams that already ship under `GMUX_PROBES=1`
 * (`window.__gmuxShotDrive`, `window.gmux.settingsSet`) or through real
 * pointer and key events sent over the DevTools protocol, and everything it
 * reads is this file's own page kit, injected from here.
 *
 * ## It judges rectangles, computed styles and hit tests, and ONE pixel per corner
 *
 * The photographs under `out/p284/` are for a person to hold beside the study
 * (`design/prototypes/index.html#surround`). One reading is taken off a
 * capture, and it is the fix round's correction: R7's OUTER point, 2px inside
 * each corner of the frame, is judged by the colour painted there and not by
 * `elementFromPoint`. The first run judged it by the hit test and read a
 * "SQUARE bottom-right corner" in six states whose photographs showed a round
 * one: the terminal's `.xterm-viewport` is a scroll container with a 10px
 * native vertical scrollbar, and Chromium hit-tests a scrollbar against its
 * rectangular box, ignoring the ancestor's rounded `overflow: clip`. The hit
 * was real and the paint was round, and the claim is about the paint. The
 * INNER point, 5px in, is still a hit test: a person can click there and
 * reach the work.
 *
 * A limit of the photographs, stated: the run emulates a 1440 by 900 viewport
 * at `deviceScaleFactor: 1`, and on a 2x display xterm's canvas then draws its
 * glyphs at half scale in the A to G captures. A person judging them by eye
 * may read that as the font shrinking. It is not: every rect and every tmux
 * pane size is read from the layout and is unaffected, and the parent's
 * captures share the artefact.
 *
 * ## The states, in this order, in ONE session (build/p284/SPEC.md S11.1)
 *
 *   A  sessions on the right, sidebar shown, one shell with 300 lines of
 *      scrollback so a thumb exists. Source Control is the default view, so
 *      A ends by asking for the Explorer once, reading R5 alone there
 *      (`.view-header` is drawn in no other state) and going back
 *   B  sessions on top
 *   C  a two-way split, and a tab dragged over it with real pointer events
 *   D  a file open at 1440 wide, which is the editor SPLIT
 *   M  THE EDITOR'S FOOT (Phase 284.1): a 400 line file scrolled to its end
 *      beside the terminal, then the Architecture map opened over the scratch
 *      repository through the pane's own door, the shape probe:p258 uses (the
 *      Architecture switch is seeded ON in each scratch profile with
 *      build/probe-arch-switch.mjs, and the map spawns no agent because the
 *      seed names none). Both are read against the body and the frame. If the
 *      pane does not open in the harness the run says so in a NOTE and reads
 *      a stand-in root wearing the map's own class instead, never nothing.
 *      Then back to D's shape, so E reads what D left
 *   E  the same at 1200 wide, which is the editor OVERLAY and its scrim
 *   F  the file filling the window
 *   G  sidebar hidden and the session list collapsed to its 48px rail
 *   H  focus mode, in and out, with the flying copy's corners recorded at the
 *      moment it is appended. THE WAY OUT IS A CLICK AND THE CHORD. Until
 *      Phase 286 entering the mode took the keyboard out of the session
 *      (`document.activeElement` became `body`, because the flight hides the
 *      surface for a moment and Chromium blurs a hidden element), and the
 *      chord is routed by where the keyboard is, so a second chord with
 *      nothing focused did nothing. The first run pressed it twice with no
 *      click between, never left, and read K, I and J INSIDE the mode, where
 *      the frame is off by design; 16 of its 33 findings were that. Since
 *      Phase 286 the flight gives the keyboard back, so a keyboard outside
 *      the session after the enter is a FINDING here; the click before the
 *      leave stays, because a person may still click, and it keeps K, I and
 *      J readable. If the chord still does not leave, Escape is tried with
 *      the keyboard out of the terminal, and if THAT does not leave the run
 *      stops, so K, I and J can never again be read with the frame off
 *   K  the projects on the left, which is the only state that draws the
 *      project rail's band and the activity bar's ROW form
 *   I  the light base
 *   J  one turned hue on the dark base (`P284_HUE`, 150 by default)
 *
 * ## The readings (SPEC S11.2)
 *
 *   R1   the gutters: 8px to each sidebar, 8px right and bottom, 0 on top
 *   R2   the line: `.work-area::after`, four 1px sides, 14px, 1px OUTSIDE the
 *        work's box, `pointer-events: none`, z-index 301, in `--border-strong`
 *   R3   the clip: every child of the frame clips itself, 13px on the outer
 *        corners and 0 on the inner ones
 *   R4   ONE complete outline in the window, and with a split exactly one
 *        more, which is Phase 40's focused-split box and is named as such;
 *        and that box's corner follows the curve wherever it is the frame's
 *        own corner, read on both panes of the split in turn (fix round)
 *   R5   quiet: the eight hairlines of SPEC S9.3, and Source Control's own
 *        header as a ninth, read alpha 0 and STILL 1px
 *   R6   the line's contrast against BOTH grounds, computed here from the
 *        computed colours, never lower than the hairline it replaces (1.297)
 *   R7   inside the curve: the pixel 2px in from each corner of the frame is
 *        painted in the SURROUND's colour, a hit test 5px in lands inside the
 *        work, and the scroll thumb's foot clears the arc by 8px
 *   R8   the drop zone a dragged tab arms sits inside the clip
 *   R9   both resizers sit in the gutter clear of the line, answer a real
 *        pointer, show `:focus-visible` in accent and move on an arrow key.
 *        THE POINTER READING SETTLES (Phase 284.1). The first form moved the
 *        pointer once and read `:hover` once, 350 ms later, and one HEAD run
 *        produced four R9 findings with boxes, gutters and keyboard widths
 *        identical to two runs that passed. MEASURED IN ONE ENVIRONMENT, and
 *        not established as the cause: in the fixer's run a
 *        `Page.captureScreenshot` between the move and the read moved the
 *        `:hover` chain from the handle to the terminal's canvas every time
 *        (0 of 6 samples lit after a forced frame, 10 of 10 without one),
 *        which reads as Blink re-dispatching hover at the OS pointer's own
 *        position when a frame is produced; the Phase 284.1 reverifier, with
 *        the OS pointer over the window, did NOT reproduce it (14 of 14 lit
 *        behind a forced frame), and its own record holds a clearing that
 *        landed inside the sleep after the second move with no frame at all.
 *        So a single sample was a coin for a reason not fully known, and the
 *        poll below is an improvement and not a closure. The arm now moves
 *        the pointer, moves it again by 1px so the last known position is
 *        the handle's, and polls `:hover` for up to about 800 ms WITHOUT
 *        forcing a frame, grading the first sample that lit, or the last one
 *        when none did, which is still a finding and never a pass. This
 *        is the one poll in the file that must not go through `settled()`,
 *        whose forced frame is the very thing that clears the reading
 *   R10  the band still reads the accent colour while a terminal has the
 *        keyboard, and the active tab still melts and follows the curve
 *   R11  selection: no marker bar, a soft fill, and the row's restrained
 *        outline
 *   R12  no pixel lost: regions plus gutters sum to the window exactly
 *   R13  the titlebar is still 38px
 *   R14  focus mode turns the frame OFF, and the flying copy wears the curve
 *   R15  THE EDITOR'S FOOT (Phase 284.1): `.ed-body` ends 8px above the frame,
 *        every root it draws starts at the body's top and ends at the body's
 *        foot, whatever its `position`, and Monaco's vertical slider with a
 *        long file scrolled to its end clears the arc by the same 8px. The
 *        fix round lifted the roots with a padding plus a per-child
 *        `bottom`, and the map, the one RELATIVE root, moved up 8px under it:
 *        it painted over the tab strip and ended 16px above the frame while
 *        every unit test stayed green, which is why this is read rendered
 *
 * The xterm columns and rows are read off THIS RUN'S tmux server at every
 * state and printed, HEAD beside the parent, so the 8 or 16px is on the page.
 * They are printed and not judged: the resize proof is `probe:sessionfocus`,
 * `probe:p1811` and `probe:p167`, which the main session runs.
 *
 * ## The parent (SPEC S11.3)
 *
 * `P284_PARENT_CHECKOUT=<a BUILT worktree at the parent commit>` runs a SECOND
 * Electron from that checkout, AFTER the first has ended and never beside it,
 * through the same readings, and prints one table with a HEAD and a PARENT
 * column. The parent is expected to FAIL. The run passes when HEAD has 0
 * findings AND the parent has at least one finding on each of R1, R2, R4, R5,
 * R11 and R15: an arm the parent also passes asserts nothing, and that is
 * itself a finding. R15 joined the list in Phase 284.1 by reasoning rather
 * than by a run: the parent has no lift at all, so its editor body ends AT
 * the frame and the body reading alone fails there.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and what it does not drive
 *
 *   - The socket `gmux` and the socket `default`, by name, before anything
 *     launches, and a run with no `GMUX_TMUX_SOCKET` at all re-runs itself
 *     under build/harness-socket.mjs rather than guessing one.
 *   - `-L gmux` is only ever asked `list-sessions`, before and after, BY
 *     IDENTITY (the Phase 171 reading in build/probe-p165-paint.mjs): a session
 *     that vanished is a finding, a fresh session THIS RUN'S scratch manifest
 *     knows is a finding, a fresh session still unstamped a second later is a
 *     finding, and a session the operator opened himself is a note. A bare
 *     count called that last one a failure on 2026-08-30 and again on
 *     2026-09-17.
 *   - Any byte outside `GMUX_HARNESS_DIR` and the photograph directory.
 *   - `conformance:hue`, and every other gate. It reads the running app.
 *   - NOT DRIVEN, and said so in the report rather than passed: a FILE dragged
 *     from Finder over a pane (`.attach-drop-zone` is lit by an OS drag no
 *     DevTools event can start), the native menus, and the View menu's radio
 *     pairs. R8 prints NOT DRIVEN when the tab drag does not arm and then
 *     asserts only the structural half, which is never a pass of the rest.
 *
 * ## Environment
 *
 *   GMUX_TMUX_SOCKET      The scratch socket. build/harness-socket.mjs sets it.
 *   GMUX_HARNESS_DIR      The scratch directory. Set by the same wrapper.
 *   P284_PARENT_CHECKOUT  A BUILT worktree at the parent commit. Optional.
 *   P284_OUT_DIR          Where the photographs and the two readings files go.
 *                         Default `out/p284`. `out/` is gitignored, and
 *                         electron-builder packs `out/**`, so remove the
 *                         directory before a package.
 *   P284_HUE              The turned hue for state J, a whole degree. 150.
 *
 * `npm run probe:p284` builds first. `--self-test` grades this file's own
 * fixtures both ways, HEAD shaped and parent shaped, and launches nothing.
 *
 * ## SAFETY
 *
 * Every Electron is started through build/electron-run.mjs's `withElectron`,
 * which ends the tree it started in a `finally` block whatever happened. The
 * socket is handed in by build/harness-socket.mjs, which names it
 * `gmux-p284-<slug>-<pid>`, ends the server afterwards and unlinks its socket
 * and marker. Every other process this script starts is a synchronous `git`,
 * `tmux` or `sqlite3` that has exited before the call returns.
